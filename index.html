        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Melvin Alatorre. I am a first-year Pre-business major at the University of California, Riverside. I want to declare my concentration in finance by the end of my second school year. I am also looking forward to new opportunities and experiences in the near future, such as internships, clubs, extracurricular activities, and events. I am currently in one club, Latino Union, and hope to join more clubs in the following year that are related to my major and future career. I would love to learn more about real estate and get a license after I graduate. After graduating from the University of California, Riverside, I hope to get my master's degree as well.<br><br>

        Background information about myself: I am currently 18 years old. I was born in Newport Beach and raised in Santa Ana for much of my life. I now live temporarily in Riverside. I graduated from Segerstrom High School in 2022. I passed multiple AP classes during high school including Calculus, Spanish, and English and I also achieved the Microsoft Office Word 2016 certification. I have 3 brothers, two older and one younger, and 3 pets, which are two dogs and one turtle. I am Mexican American as both my parents are from Mexico. I am bilingual. I learned how to speak Spanish by communicating every day with my parents and others in my community.  I am proud of my culture and its values that have shaped who I am today. I love spending time with my family and celebrating traditional Mexican holidays with them. <br><br>

        The things I enjoy doing the most are playing soccer, working out, watching anime and youtube, and playing video games. I also like to read non-fictional books here and there. I have played soccer for most of my life since the age of six. I played in clubs throughout my childhood and also on the high school varsity team. While playing soccer in high school, I won Offensive MVP for the frosh/soph team and also Top GPA Award for the Varsity team. I also like working out at the gym in UCR and occasionally at my house. In the future, I want to have the financial freedom to travel around the world and visit countries I have always wanted to such as Spain, France, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, UAE, South Korea, and many more. I want to explore different cities, food, and cultures throughout the world and attend football (soccer) games across Europe, especially from my favorite teams such as FC Barcelona and Arsenal.
